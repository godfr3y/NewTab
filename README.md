[zombieFox](https://github.com/zombieFox)'s [nightTab](https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab) browser extension inspired me to make my very own NewTab page.

# Setup

### Firefox and LibreWolf

Here are some guides:
- [Firefox](https://peterries.net/blog/firefox-set-file-as-home/);
- [LibreWolf](https://codetea.com/a-guide-to-make-librewolf-have-a-different-start-page-for-the-homepage-and-new-tabs/).

### Chromium

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn on 'Developer mode' in the top left corner
3. Finally click 'Load unpacked' and select the root of the extension directory (in this cas `src`).
