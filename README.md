NewTab is a customized browser starting page.

[zombieFox](https://github.com/zombieFox)'s [nightTab](https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab) browser extension inspired me to make my very own browser starting page.

# Setup

### Firefox based 
To use a local html file as the firefox `new tab` page, follow this [article](https://peterries.net/blog/firefox-set-file-as-home/).

### Chromium based
From the broswer [extensions page](chrome://extensions), turn on the **Developer mode**; a bunch of new buttons will pop out. click **Load unpacked** and select the `NewTab` directory. 

# Things to do

- [ ] Reduce the page loading time by:
  - compressing the images;
  - implementing [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) widgets with the TradingView api;
- [ ] in the future, the quote tile will display a random quote from a selection.
- [ ] manually fix the misalignment of diffrent sized tiles.
